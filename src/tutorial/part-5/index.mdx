## Introduction

- "In the previous section, you learned..." Refresh their knowledge for anything theyâ€™ve learned in the previous sections that will be relevant to this part.
- Brief paragraph (2-3 sentences) to highlight context and relevance.
- Explain the goal of this part of the tutorial. Show diagrams, list acceptance criteria for desired end result.

## What You Will Learn

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Bullet list of learning objectives. Focus on transferable skills. (What are the things they'll be able to apply to a new situation?)

## Background

- Separate sections (labeled by `h3` titles) explaining all the content students will need to be able to complete the exercises.

## Exercise #1: Use `gatsby-plugin-mdx` to render your blog post contents

### Goal

1. Add `gatsby-plugin-mdx` to your site.
1. Update your `/blog` page to display the contents of each `.mdx` blog post.

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>

* Remember the three steps for setting up a plugin?
* Update your page query to use `allMdx` instead.
* Use the `<MDXRenderer>` component to render the content of your blog posts.

</details>

You'll learn more if you work through the exercise on your own.

But if you get stuck, here's [one possible solution](https://github.com/meganesu/gatsby-intro-workshop-example-site/commit/1f4c843cd1c6c8e4eaba9c62d788665c4aa61b63).

## Challenge (Extra Credit)

With MDX, you can use components inside your `.mdx` files. Try adding a component to one of your blog posts.


## Summary

- Bullet list of key takeaways (alt: checks for understanding, using `<details>` elements?)
- 1-2 sentences teasing how this section connects to the next section (no details, just enough of a hook to motivate them to keep going)

<PreviousNext
  prevTo="/part-4"
  prevText="Part 4"
  nextTo="/part-6"
  nextText="Part 6"
/>
