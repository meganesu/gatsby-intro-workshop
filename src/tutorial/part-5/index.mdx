## Introduction

In this section you will learn to use `gatsby-plugin-mdx` to render the content on a screen. 

## What You Will Learn

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Process transform file nodes into MDX nodes by using  `gatsby-plugin-mdx`


## Background

Right now, even though you can access the File node for your .mdx file, you can’t actually render the contents, because `gatsby-source-filesystem` doesn’t know about how to process MDX. 
This is why we will need the MDX plugin. 

### How to use MDX Plugin 

1. Install Plugin `npm install gatsby-plugin-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react`
2. Add plugin to your plugins list in your `gatsby-config.js`. 

> Note that gatsby-plugin-mdx requires gatsby-source-filesystem to be present and configured to process local markdown files in order to generate the resulting Gatsby nodes.
```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `blog`,
        path: `${__dirname}/blog/`,
      },
    },
    `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
  ],
}
```

## Challenge (Extra Credit)
