## Introduction

- "In the previous section, you learned..." Refresh their knowledge for anything theyâ€™ve learned in the previous sections that will be relevant to this part.
- Brief paragraph (2-3 sentences) to highlight context and relevance.
- Explain the goal of this part of the tutorial. Show diagrams, list acceptance criteria for desired end result.

## What You Will Learn

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Bullet list of learning objectives. Focus on transferable skills. (What are the things they'll be able to apply to a new situation?)

## Background

- Separate sections (labeled by `h3` titles) explaining all the content students will need to be able to complete the exercises.

## Exercise #1: Create separate pages for each blog post

### Goal

1. Use the File System Route API to automatically create separate pages for each of your blog posts.
1. Link each post title on the `/blog` page to the corresponding page for that post.

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>

1. Create a new file for your blog post template page.
1. Define the new component for your blog post template.
    * Write the query to pull in data for a single post.
    * Move the `<MDXRenderer>` code out of the `/blog` page and into the template page.

You'll learn more if you work through the exercise on your own.

But if you get stuck, here's [one possible solution](https://github.com/meganesu/gatsby-intro-workshop-example-site/commit/258166124dd2cbcc633eb8e9f3ef70b29e07e2e5).

## Summary

- Bullet list of key takeaways (alt: checks for understanding, using `<details>` elements?)
- 1-2 sentences teasing how this section connects to the next section (no details, just enough of a hook to motivate them to keep going)

<PreviousNext
  prevTo="/part-5"
  prevText="Part 5"
  nextTo="/part-7"
  nextText="Part 7"
/>
