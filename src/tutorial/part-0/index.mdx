## Introduction

Welcome to the Getting Started with Gatsby workshop! We're excited you're here.

In this part, you'll set up your computer with all the tools you'll need for the workshop.

## Installation Guide

Here is a brief list of all the tools you'll need to have on your computer before the workshop.

For a more detailed list of installation instructions, refer to [Part 0 of the official Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-zero/).

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
    * To check your installation, run the following two commands in your terminal:
        ```shell
        npm --version
        node --version
        ```
        They should each display a version number and then exit without any errors.
* Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). (If you're on a Mac, this should already be installed.)
    * To check, run `git --version` in your terminal. You should get an output similar to:
        ```shell
        git version 2.24.3 (Apple Git-128)
        ```
* Install the [Gatsby command line interface (CLI)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-cli). You'll need v2.31.1 or later.
    * To check, run `gatsby --version` in your terminal. You should get an output similar to:
        ```shell
        Gatsby CLI version: 2.17.0
        Gatsby version: 2.32.3
          Note: this is the Gatsby version for the site at:
        /Users/megansullivan/Documents/gatsby/intro-workshop-example
        ```
* Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
* Create a free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
* Create a free [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/dashboard/) account.

## Summary

Now that you have all the tools you'll need, you're ready for the workshop!
