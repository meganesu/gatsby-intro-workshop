<Subhead>Welcome to the Getting Started with Gatsby Workshop!</Subhead>

In this workshop, you'll learn the fundamental Gatsby concepts by building a blog with MDX. Here's an [example site](https://introworkshopexamplesitev3.gatsbyjs.io/) to show what your finished product might look like.

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

* Create and deploy a new Gatsby site.
* Add plugins to your site.
* Use GraphQL to pull data into your site.
* Use new Gatsby features like `gatsby-plugin-image` and the File System Route API.

Not sure what any of that means? No problem! You will by the end of the workshop.

## Prerequisites

Prior to the workshop, please go through <StyledLink to="/part-0">Part 0</StyledLink> to make sure you have all the necessary tools installed.

For this workshop, we’re assuming you have some knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You don’t have to be an expert, but you should feel comfortable writing HTML, styling elements with classes, and creating functions. Want to brush up your skills? Check out the [Gatsby Web Creators playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCU2qJekvcN2KKkCAOvkhcC5tfOKOQzR9) on YouTube.

  New to React? We’ll cover the basics in the workshop. But if you want to prep
  beforehand, you can look up how to create components, how to use props, and
  how the children prop works.
