  the workshop.

<H2>Installation Guide</H2>

Here is a brief list of all the tools you'll need to have on your computer before
the workshop.

For a more detailed list of installation instructions, refer to [Part 0 of the official Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-zero/).

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
  - To check your installation, run the following two commands in your terminal:
    ```shell
    npm --version
    node --version
    ```
    They should each display a version number and then exit without any errors.
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). (If you're on a Mac, this should already be installed.)
  - To check, run `git --version` in your terminal. You should get an output similar to:
    ```shell
    git version 2.24.3 (Apple Git-128)
    ```
- Install the [Gatsby command line interface (CLI)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-cli). You'll need v2.31.1 or later.
  - To check, run `gatsby --version` in your terminal. You should get an output similar to:
    ```shell
    Gatsby CLI version: 2.17.0
    Gatsby version: 2.32.3
      Note: this is the Gatsby version for the site at:
    /Users/megansullivan/Documents/gatsby/intro-workshop-example
    ```
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
- Create a free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
- Create a free [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/dashboard/) account.
